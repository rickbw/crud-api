/**
 * An abstract stateful entity, whose value may be retrieved via the

 * A Resource is assumed to be relatively expensive to work with -- for
 * example, its state may need to be fetched from storage or transferred to
 * the program across a network.
 * <p/>
 * Resource methods return {@link Observable}s. Implementers are strongly
 * advised <em>not</em> to emit {@code null} to those {@code Observable}s. If
 * the intention is to indicate an absent value, the correct approach is to
 * emit no values at all; {@link Observer#onCompleted()} will indicate
 * completion. An intrinsically empty state, which can indicate only "empty"
 * or "unknown because of error", may further be expressed with by the
 * declaration idiom {@code Observable<Void>}.
